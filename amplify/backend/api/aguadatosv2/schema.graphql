# This "input" configures a global authorization rule to enable public access to
# all models in this schema. Learn more about authorization rules here: https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/authorization-rules
input AMPLIFY { globalAuthRule: AuthRule = { allow: public } } # FOR TESTING ONLY!

# NOTE: Due to AWS Amplify lack of support for polymorphism or union types, we had to denormalized the
# schema significantly.

# FUTURE IMPROVEMENT: A strategy to bypasses the lack of support would be to create an intermediary
# model called Entry to store metadata like author, createdAt, Entry type discriminator. Each
# entry's actual data are stored in their respective Entry models. However, this approach would
# require GraphQL resolvers, which are beyond our current scope and beta testing deadline.
